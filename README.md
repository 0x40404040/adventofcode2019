# Advent of Code 2019
This repository contains my solutions to Advent of code 2019.

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) - An advent calendar with  2 small programming puzzles every day.  


To run, test or benchmark the code, navigate in any **day_XX** directory and use one of the listed commands.


```
run Problem 1
	$ cargo run -- 1
run Problem 2
	$ cargo run -- 2

run test:
	$ cargo test

run benchmarks:
	$ cargo bench
```


*Benchmarks are not done for every day.

## Common directory
[./common]("./common") is a helper library for 
shared code between days and 
reexporting external crates.
